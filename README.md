# Autocomplete---project

I created two classes that implement the Autocompletor interface. I implemented the Autocomplete interface, BinarySearchAutocomplete and HashListAutocomplete and then tested each using JUnit tests. 

I also had to implement the PrefixComparator.compare method used in the BinarySearchAutocomplete class.
